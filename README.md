# Pneumonia-Detection-IP-project-2020-
Corona (Covid-19) virus is a global pandemic threatening all countries with its virality and quick spread so much so that there is not enough specialists or equipment to effectively detect patients with covid-19 to be able to supply proper measures and treatments for them.
so our Vision aimed at facilitating the process of filtering potential covid-19 patients for further inspections as pneumonia is a common symptom for those affected with covid-19 (similar to SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov).
Only 18% demonstrate normal chest radiographs or CT when mild or early in the disease course, but this decreases to 3% in severe disease, of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, 69% had an abnormal chest radiograph at the initial time of admission, and 80% had radiographic abnormalities sometime during hospitalization.
Benefits:
Although pneumonia isn’t a symptom that certainly identifies a corona patient it is a common factor and in this current period it is a symptom worth considering.
So, this project’s goal is to be able to quickly identify pneumonia patients without the aid of doctors and specialists in an effort to speed up check-ups and perhaps even allowing for less crowding at clinics and hospitals.
